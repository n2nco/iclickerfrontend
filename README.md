# iclickerfrontend

```
  yarn 
  yarn start (local)
  yarn build (can paste build folder into server folder & serve that path)
```

  Note: to simulate stripe checkout use the following 'test credit card' - all 42s
  card num: 4242 4242 4242 4242
  exp: 42/42 cvv: 424
  postal: 424242

  Issue: build folder css formatting differs from local (yarn start) css formatting
